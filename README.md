## Steps
1. Take both decks and mix them together
2. Shuffle the decks well
    - This will create a mega deck, as two of the decks are combined
3. Deal the combined, shuffled decks to players
4. Go over set rules for the game
    - Different people have different rules, so having the rules set right off the bat is essential

## My Version's Rules
1. If the card has a plus, it can be played on top of another card with a plus
    - Plus 2s can be played on plus 4s and vice versa
    - This results in maximum chaosðŸ˜ˆ
2. If you have two cards of the same number, they can be stacked and played
    - As long as it's the same number/symbol, it can be stacked
    - Ex) You have a green 7 and a blue 7. Both cards can be played
3. If someone says "Uno" before you say it (and you actually have Uno), you must pick up a card
4. If you were plus 2'd and/or plus 4'd, you can still play from your current set of cards
    - Your turn is not skipped
5. If you didn't have a card and you had to pick one up, you can still play a card
6. If it's not your turn, but the top card on a pile is the same as one you have, you can "jump in" and play the card
   - The people before you get their turns skipped, and the person after you continues
   - Jump ins can be done at any time during the game
